# NIMG_Pares-Pujolras_etal_2020

This repository contains analysis code for the following paper: Parés-Pujolràs E., Travers, E., Ahmetoglu, Y., Haggard, P. Evidence accumulation under uncertainty - a neural marker of choice and urgency. NeuroImage (2020)

The scripts and data files included in the repository enable the replication of the data analysis and figures reported in the paper.

The folder DATA contains several data files in various formats that allow the replication of all the results and figures reported in the paper. 

  • NIMG_2020_PP_Data.csv
  
  • NIMG_2020_PP_SummaryData.csv

The folder SCRIPTS contains three main scripts:

  • NIMG_2020_PP_Analysis.r 
  
  • NIMG_2020_PP_Modelling.py
  
The "NIMG_2020_PP_Modelling.py" script contains the code used to run the computational evidence accumulation and urgency models reported in the paper. This script relies on functions from the 'Evidently' package, which can be found at https://github.com/EoinTravers/Evidently.
